# Hello ðŸ‘‹
Here are my 2 mini spam programs made in python

#### There is 2 programme :
* First ( SpamBot_msg_unique ) spam as many times as requested a single message
* seconde ( SpamBot ) spam all file content "txt_spamBot.txt"

## How use it ?
* For the first, type the number of times the message has been spammed in the brackets (Line 6) then the message between the quotation marks (Line 7).
* For the second, just put the text you want to spam in the file txt_spamBot.
* Finally launch the program. Once launched, you have 5 seconds to put your cursor in a text box.

âš  The program may cause your computer and connection to crawl. To minimize problems, add the following line of code at the end of the loop to put a cooldown between each message.
### `sleep(1)`
Put in brackets the number of seconds to wait between 2 messages.
